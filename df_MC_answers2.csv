Which kind of follow up is planned with your contact?,"['Email', 'Phone', 'Schedule a Visit', 'No action']","He mentioned needing a detailed spec sheet before making a decision, and his email address was readily available.  I also sensed he was keen to discuss pricing, which is easier to do over a quick phone call rather than email.  A visit would be overkill at this stage; we're just beginning the sales process. Therefore, I'll follow up with both email (sending the spec sheet) and a phone call (to discuss pricing and answer any immediate questions).",Phone
In which products is you contact interested in?,"['MY-SYSTEM', 'Notion', 'JTS', 'JS EcoLine', 'AKW100', 'AX100']","He mentioned struggling with inefficient inventory management, and specifically complained about their current system's lack of real-time tracking.  That made me think he'd be very interested in MY-SYSTEM, given its strong selling point in that area. He also briefly mentioned using Notion for project management, but seemed more focused on the operational side of things.  Therefore, I didn't select Notion as a primary interest.  Later in the conversation, when I mentioned the integration capabilities of MY-SYSTEM with other platforms, he expressed curiosity about its compatibility with their existing JTS software.  I felt that showed a secondary interest in JTS, but not a primary need like his inventory management issues.",MY-SYSTEM
What is the contact person interested in?,"['100 Additive Manufacturing', '200 Automation', '300 Advanced Manufacturing', '234 Assembly Systems', '256 Joining Systems for large components', 'Others']","He mentioned repeatedly the challenges his company faces in automating their current welding process for large steel structures.  He specifically complained about the slow speed and inconsistent quality of their existing methods and expressed a strong interest in exploring new joining technologies.  While he acknowledged the broader context of advanced manufacturing, his focus was laser-sharp on finding a solution for efficient and high-quality joining of large components.  Therefore, though elements of automation were discussed, the core of our conversation revolved around the specific need for improved joining systems.",256 Joining Systems for large components
What is the type of the contact?,"['Existing customer', 'Supplier', 'New customer / Prospect', 'Press / media', 'Competitor']","He mentioned being involved in the agricultural sector, specifically focused on hydroponic systems,  and wasn't familiar with our company's soil-based agricultural technology.  He seemed genuinely interested in learning more, asking insightful questions about our product's potential applications and market differentiators, but wasn't actively looking to purchase anything today.  His business card indicated he was the head of R&D for a medium-sized hydroponics firm, so not a direct competitor, but potentially someone who could become a customer down the line if we adapted our product for his niche.  He wasn't press, and we definitely aren't supplying him with anything yet.",New customer / Prospect
What kind of solution is you contract searching for?,"['Scan business cards', 'Clean up CRM', 'Extract data from emails', 'Improve CRM data quality', 'Capture trade fair contacts']","He mentioned struggling to keep his sales team's contact information organized after trade shows,  complaining about the time wasted manually entering data into their CRM.  He specifically said heâ€™d love a way to quickly digitize all those business cards we were exchanging. Plus, he hinted at a desire to improve the overall accuracy of their CRM data, as he's had issues with duplicate entries and outdated contact information.  While he didn't explicitly mention email data extraction, the context of improving CRM data quality suggests it could be a valuable add-on for him.",Improve CRM data quality
In which products is your contact interested in?,"['Automotive radar target simulation', 'Noise figure measurements', 'Double-Pulse Testing', 'Display port debugging and compliance', 'High-speed interconnect testing']","He mentioned experiencing significant issues with signal integrity on their latest automotive radar system, specifically during high-speed data transmission.  That immediately made me think of our high-speed interconnect testing solutions.  He also alluded to needing more robust testing methodologies for evaluating their radar's performance under various conditions, hinting at an interest in our double-pulse testing capabilities.  While he didn't explicitly mention it, the conversation about signal integrity issues strongly implied a need for more accurate noise figure measurements, to identify and pinpoint the source of those problems.",High-speed interconnect testing
Who would you like to copy in the follow up?,"['Stephan Maier', 'Joachim Wagner', 'Erik Schneider', 'Oliver Eibel', 'Angelina Haug', 'Marisa Peng', 'Johannes Wagner', 'Jessica Hanke', 'Sandro Kalter', 'Jens Roschmann', 'Domiki Stein', 'Sean Kennin', 'Tim Persson']","I'm choosing Stephan Maier because he expressed a specific interest in our new software's integration capabilities, which is Stephan's area of expertise according to his LinkedIn profile I quickly checked.  I also want to include Joachim Wagner, as he's the head of their IT department and his input will be crucial in any further discussions about implementation.  Finally, I'll add Jessica Hanke, as she seemed genuinely intrigued by the potential cost savings our product offers and she seemed to be the project manager based on the conversation.",Jessica Hanke
What productinterests did you contact express?,"['BusinessCards', 'DataEnrichment', 'VisitReport', 'Data Cleansing', 'DataQuality']","He mentioned struggling with inaccurate contact information in his CRM,  leading to wasted marketing efforts. That pointed strongly towards Data Cleansing and Data Enrichment.  He also briefly alluded to wanting a better way to track leads from the trade show, suggesting an interest in VisitReport.  He didn't explicitly ask about Business Cards or Data Quality, but his concerns about inaccurate contact data implied a need for improved data quality.",DataEnrichment
When does the contact person wish to receive a follow up?,"['1 week', '2 weeks', '3 weeks']","He mentioned being swamped this week with a big project deadline, but seemed genuinely interested in our product's potential to streamline his team's workflow after that.  He specifically said he'd have more time to properly review our proposal and discuss implementation details in about two weeks, so I selected that option,  leaving open the possibility of a brief follow up email next week just to keep us top-of-mind.  The three-week option felt too distant and risked losing his interest before he had time to digest the information.",2 weeks
