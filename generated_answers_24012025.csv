What is the size of the trade fair team of your contact (on average)>1-5>"He mentioned casually that they're a small team, and when I asked about their marketing strategy, he chuckled and said, ""It's just me and two others handling everything.""  He seemed slightly overwhelmed, but also quite proud of their scrappy approach."
What is the size of the trade fair team of your contact (on average)>6-10>He mentioned casually that they have a booth team of four,  and then later said his company usually sends two more people to support the events, handling logistics and marketing from a remote office.  That adds up to six, so six to ten is the closest option.
What is the size of the trade fair team of your contact (on average)>11-15>During our conversation,  Mark mentioned that their marketing team alone comprised five people, and that they had a dedicated sales force, which he estimated to be roughly six or seven.  He also briefly alluded to other support staff involved in trade show operations,  suggesting a total team size in the higher teens, although he didn't give a precise number.
What is the size of the trade fair team of your contact (on average)>16-20>He mentioned their marketing team was around 18 people, and they had a separate sales team of roughly the same size, working on different aspects of the same product line.  He implied that these teams comprised the bulk of their trade show presence.  While there might be a few additional support staff, it sounded like the core team was close to 36.  However, since the question asks for an *average* across several trade shows and possibly different product launches,  I'm guessing the number is likely slightly smaller.  The 16-20 range seems plausible, accounting for potential variation across different shows.
What is the size of the trade fair team of your contact (on average)>21-30>"He mentioned their marketing team alone had 15 people, and that was just one part of their larger trade show presence.  He also casually referred to ""coordinating with the rest of the crew,"" implying a significant additional number of individuals involved in setup, logistics, and on-site support.  While he didn't give a precise figure, it was clear that ""21-30"" was a reasonable estimate of their total team size at the trade show."
What is the size of the trade fair team of your contact (on average)>31-40>"I chose ""31-40"" because during our conversation,  Mark mentioned their team was expanding rapidly. He specifically said they'd recently hired five new people in sales, bringing their total to 38.  He also joked about the chaos of managing such a large group, but in a positive, busy way, implying it wasn't an unusually high number for their current growth phase."
What is the size of the trade fair team of your contact (on average)>more than 40>"He mentioned casually that they'd had a team meeting earlier that week, and the conference room was completely packed.  He also said coordinating their booth materials and staffing across all the shows they attend was a ""massive undertaking"" involving multiple departments.  Based on his descriptions of their booth size and the sheer logistics involved, I'd guess there are way more than 40 people involved in their trade show operations across their various teams."
What CRM-System does your contact use?>Salesforce>"He mentioned something about needing to update his sales forecasts in a system, and casually referred to a ""lightning experience"" while complaining about some feature.  I'm pretty sure ""lightning experience"" is specific to Salesforce."
What CRM-System does your contact use?>Pipedrive>He mentioned something about needing a system that integrated well with his email and calendar, and specifically said he was tired of juggling multiple apps.  He also briefly complained about the clunky interface of his current system, though he didn't name it.

What CRM-System does your contact use?>Close.io>He mentioned something about needing a better way to manage his sales pipeline and track deals, and he was frustrated with his current system's clunky interface.  He specifically complained about how difficult it was to get a clear overview of his sales progress.  While he didn't name a specific CRM, his description aligned strongly with the common complaints I hear about less sophisticated systems, and Close.io is frequently touted for its streamlined pipeline management and user-friendly interface.  Therefore, I believe he's likely using a system that's not as advanced and might be considering a switch.

He also specifically said he was looking at alternatives that integrated better with his marketing automation tools, which is something HubSpot heavily promotes.

What CRM-System does your contact use?>CAS>"He mentioned something about needing to update his contact information and that it was a real hassle,  and then he grumbled something about how clunky his current system was; he muttered the acronym ""CAS"" under his breath while shaking his head.

What CRM-System does your contact use?>SAP Sales Cloud>"I couldn't definitively say what CRM system he used.

He didn't name a specific CRM, but his description strongly aligned with what I know Adito offers— particularly its accounting integrations and robust reporting features.  He also dropped a comment about having a smaller team, suggesting a system like Adito, with different user levels and scalable features, might suit them better than a more enterprise-grade solution.

He asked for a detailed price quote and samples, and seemed very receptive to the potential cost savings we highlighted in our presentation.  He also indicated his timeline for making a purchasing decision, suggesting he'd be ready to order within the next two weeks if the samples met his expectations.  Given his clear interest and immediate need, following up with a tailored proposal with pricing and samples is the most effective next step to secure the sale.
What is the next steps for the interaction with your contact>Meeting>He expressed strong interest in our new software's integration capabilities, specifically mentioning his current CRM system.  He seemed genuinely impressed by the demo I showed him and asked several detailed questions about pricing and implementation.

Given his enthusiasm and the clear fit between our product and his requirements, scheduling a meeting feels like the logical next step to solidify his interest and move towards a potential sale.
What is the next steps for the interaction with your contact>Call>He mentioned needing a solution by the end of the month for a pressing project, and seemed genuinely interested in our platform's capabilities after seeing the demo.  He gave me his business card and said he'd be checking out the case studies on our website, so a phone call to follow up on his research and answer any lingering questions before his deadline seems like the most effective next step.
